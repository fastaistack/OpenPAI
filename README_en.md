## 📦 Installation & Deployment

### 1. Prerequisites
1. **OpenStation** must be installed and running first.
2. A **Docker** environment is recommended for pulling the OpenPAI image.
3. **Database Credentials** (matching the environment variables you will provide at runtime).

### 2. Pull OpenPAI Docker Image
```bash
docker pull easyds-registry.cn-beijing.cr.aliyuncs.com/faststack/openpai:v1.0
```

Check if the image is successfully pulled:
```bash
docker images
```

You should see `easyds-registry.cn-beijing.cr.aliyuncs.com/faststack/openpai:v1.0` in the list.

### 3. Run OpenPAI Container
```bash
docker run -d --rm \
  --name CONTAINER-NAME \
  --network=openstation \
  -p HOST_PORT:8080 \
  -e OPEN_DB_HOST=DB-HOST \
  -e OPEN_DB_USER=DB-USER \
  -e OPEN_DB_PASSWORD=DB-PASSWORD \
  easyds-registry.cn-beijing.cr.aliyuncs.com/faststack/openpai:v1.0
```
- **CONTAINER-NAME**: Container name.
- **HOST_PORT**: Port used to access the platform.
- **HOST-IP**: Database IP address.
- **DB-USER** and **DB-PASSWORD**: Database root user credentials for OpenPAI.

Once running, you can open a web browser and navigate to `http://<HOST-IP>:<HOST_PORT>` to access the OpenPAI login page.

### 4. Logging In
On the login screen, use the **OpenStation** credentials to sign in. If login is successful, you will see the OpenPAI homepage.
